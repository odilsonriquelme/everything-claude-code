# ECC v2.0.0-rc.1 Publication Evidence - 2026-05-18

This is release-readiness evidence only. It does not create a GitHub release,
npm publication, plugin tag, marketplace submission, or announcement post.

## Source Commit

| Field | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Upstream main | `3b7e0ba30a027ffd3319c2f145c63076c296d80a` |
| Git remote | `https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git` |
| Evidence scope | Current `main` after PR #1970 workflow-security validator bypass fixes, PR #1971 metrics bridge cost-reporting fixes, PR #1972 `uncloud` skill merge, catalog/operator dashboard refresh, Mini Shai-Hulud/TanStack protection recheck, current-head Supply-Chain Watch, work-items sync, and Linear progress sync |
| Local status caveat | `git status --short --branch` showed `## main...origin/main` plus unrelated untracked `docs/drafts/`; generated evidence files are committed after the source snapshot they describe |

The actual release operator should repeat all publish-facing checks from the
final release commit with a strictly clean checkout before publishing.

## Queue And Discussion State

| Surface | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trunk PRs | `gh pr list --limit 100 --json number,title,state,author,updatedAt,url` | 0 open PRs |
| Trunk issues | `gh issue list --limit 100 --json number,title,state,updatedAt,url,labels` | 0 open issues |
| Discussion audit | `npm run discussion:audit -- --json` | Ready; 58 sampled discussions in `affaan-m/everything-claude-code`, 0 needing maintainer touch, 0 answerable discussions missing accepted answer, and 0 fetch errors |
| Platform audit | `node scripts/platform-audit.js --json --allow-untracked docs/drafts/` | Ready; tracked repos report 0 open PRs, 0 open issues, 0 discussion maintainer-touch gaps, 0 answerable Q&A missing accepted answers, and 0 blocking dirty files |
| Work-items sync | `node scripts/work-items.js sync-github --repo <tracked-repo>` for five tracked repos; `node scripts/status.js --json`; `node scripts/work-items.js list --json` | All five tracked repos synced with 0 open PRs/issues and no changed work items; local status reports 0 open, 0 blocked, and 0 closed work items |
| Operator dashboard | `npm run operator:dashboard -- --markdown --allow-untracked docs/drafts/ --write docs/releases/2.0.0-rc.1/operator-readiness-dashboard-2026-05-18.md` | Generated current dashboard for `3b7e0ba30a027ffd3319c2f145c63076c296d80a`; dashboard ready true, publication ready false because release, npm, plugin, billing, and announcement gates are approval-gated |

Tracked repositories in the platform audit and work-items sync were:

- `affaan-m/everything-claude-code`
- `affaan-m/agentshield`
- `affaan-m/JARVIS`

## Supply-Chain And Security Evidence

| Gate | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repo IOC scan | `npm run security:ioc-scan` | Passed; 198 files inspected |

| Advisory source refresh | `node scripts/ci/supply-chain-advisory-sources.js --refresh --json` | Ready with 9 sources; live refresh produced 1 OpenAI URL warning from Node fetch while primary TanStack, GitHub advisory, StepSecurity, Wiz, Socket, npm, and CISA sources returned OK |

## Linear Progress Sync

| Surface | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| ITO-57 issue comment | `0b9931b9-1556-4ebc-a70c-f3635557625d` records May 18 queue counts, #1970/#1971/#1972 merge evidence, supply-chain verification, current-head watch URL, deferred gates, and next slices |
| ECC platform project comment | `e32e5b7a-287b-4bf4-9ed7-314389a157e1` records the same current public queue, security, and remaining-gate state at the project level |
| Project status update caveat | Linear returned "Project status updates are not enabled for this workspace"; project comment was used as the supported status surface |

## Current Publication Blockers

- GitHub prerelease `v2.0.0-rc.1` is still not created in this pass.
- npm `ecc-universal@2.0.0-rc.1` is still not published to the `next`
  dist-tag.
- Claude plugin tag and marketplace propagation remain approval-gated.
- Codex repo-marketplace distribution is verified for rc.1, but official
  Plugin Directory publishing remains blocked on OpenAI's self-serve publishing
  surface.
- ECC Tools billing/native-payments copy remains blocked until a Marketplace
  purchase/webhook path writes production `account-billing:*` and
  `billing-state:*` records, then `npm run billing:announcement-gate --
  --account <github-login>` returns an announcement-ready gate.
- Release notes, X, LinkedIn, GitHub release, and longform copy still need final
  live URLs after release/package/plugin URLs exist.
- The local checkout still has unrelated untracked `docs/drafts/`, so a strict
  clean-checkout release pass remains required before real publication.

## Result

The tracked public PR queue, issue queue, discussion queue, local work-items
bridge, and Mini Shai-Hulud/TanStack protection loop are current on
May 18, 2026 for `3b7e0ba3`. This improves publication readiness but does not
replace the approval-gated release, package, plugin, billing, and announcement
steps in `publication-readiness.md`.
